# 👋 Hi, I'm rayanova-x

I'm an **ML Engineer** passionate about leveraging AI to build intelligent systems that make a real-world impact.  
Currently, I'm focused on developing **recommender systems** and applying AI to solve complex **supply chain** challenges.

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools
*Machine Learning is my playground!*  
I work with modern AI frameworks and love experimenting with new technologies, including:
- **Python libraries:** TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, seaborn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **LangChain** for building robust language model applications
- **Google Cloud Document AI** for intelligent document processing
